We're developing smart workout shirts that monitor your heart rate and tell you when you're burning fat during your workout. We embed a tiny heart rate monitor in our shirts and connect three, tiny LED lights on the outside of our shirts that blink when the user is in the fat burning zone during their workout. 

We're looking for a hardware engineer to connect the software we're running that measures heart rate with the LED lights so they blink when the user is in the fat burning zone. If you have any questions, reply to this post or feel free to call me at (408) 316-9815.

Who We Are

theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code with several Bay Area locations and growing. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World.  

www.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary


theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world!  You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience.  This is a part-time position for 2-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule.  Our open hours will be generally 3-8pm on select weekdays and 10am-5pm on Saturdays.

We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a teaching methodology than a curriculum.  Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.




Responsibilities 

A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code.  At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.


1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.  One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids.  Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger folks, with Python or Javascript/HTML or Java, C++ and beyond for the advanced kids.

2. PLUS Group Session.  A social group session with a larger student to coach ratio. The coach's role is to mentor the students towards an end goal of presenting one of their apps at our Coder Fair.


3. Code Class.  Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.

This position rocks because you will:
 - Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are excited to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application. 
 - Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.
 - Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology


Requirements

What do we want from you?  Read on.
 - PASSION.  All caps!  This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
 - Great Communicator.  There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
 - Street Cred.  Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school.  Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
 - Coding Skills.  Strong grasp of basic procedural programming.  General knowledge of other languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.
- Teaching Experience.  Experience teaching kids in any subject is a plus, as is experience with Scratch or Snap.

**We are currently looking to hire coders who can teach PYTHON and more**

Who We Are

theCoderSchool San Jose is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code. We provide a fun and inspirational environment to bring out that inner coder in all kids!

Job Summary

theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience.

This is a part-time position for anywhere from 2-15 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability. These hours can be sometime between 2-8pm Monday-Thursday and 9am-3pm on Sundays.

Responsibilities

A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.

Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculums.
App Team.Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a complex app together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.
Code Class.Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.
RequirementsWhat do we want from you? Read on.

PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
Coding Skills. We are currently looking to hire coders who can teach PYTHON.
Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, C++ are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.
The ideal candidate should have additional experience in after school programs, teaching, education, tutoring, or has a student background in coding or software development.

Sound awesome? Respond with your resume!

About Us:

Cerebellum Capital is a San Francisco based ""pure play"" machine learning hedge fund (many
funds claim this - we focus entirely on it). From its founding in 2008 Cerebellum has focused on
creating a factory that automates the discovery and evaluation of investment strategies. By
doing this Cerebellum has automated the role of the data scientist, the analyst, and the
investment committee. We believe this level of automation removes the overfitting risks that
have hampered performance in the traditional quant research process. As such, Cerebellum
has an edge in harnessing the power of modern machine learning to systematically create high-
capacity investment strategies and products.


We are an evolving and nimble team that highly values collaboration, inventiveness and
initiative. We constantly evolve our learning, signals and systems to improve our strategies. We
all share a passion for ML and financial markets. We operate at the intersection of data, ML,
engineering and math. We value our tools and are dedicated to growing and improving our suite
of automated signal and strategy tests. Most of all, we value our open and collaborative
environment where we all gain from the training and mentorship of a team we trust. We all wear
many hats, have significant responsibilities and a high degree of autonomy.


About The Opportunity:

As a software engineer at Cerebellum you will work with a dynamic team solving some of the
hardest challenges in data, modeling and infrastructure and seeing your work add to the Firm’s
bottom line. You will work with cloud technologies to help build out the next generation of ML
infrastructure that is cloud native, massively scalable and easy to configure and manage. You
will interact on a daily basis with our modeling and data teams and help prioritize and drive
projects across ML modeling, data pipelines, reporting pipelines and strategy development and
deployment.


About You:

You have worked with arrays, tables and multi-dimensional data structures. You love tinkering
with databases, data formats, layouts, on-disk and on-wire compression and the interface
between ML and infrastructure. You are proud of the code you author and are passionate about
optimization, testing and profiling. You love working in a collegial, collaborative environment with
very smart people and enjoy diversity in the projects you work on.


What You’ll Need:

5+ years of professional software development experience in a Linux environment
Excellent ability to produce simple, efficient code in Python, numpy, pandas, xarray etc
Some exposure to scipy, tensorflow, keras etc is useful
Knowledge of database and network technologies a plus
Ability and willingness to take full ownership (design, implement, test, deploy, maintain,
iterate) of projects
Comfort resolving uncertainty and communicating for issue resolution
Ability to collaborate, mentor and educate
Interest in global financial markets

What You’ll Get:

Competitive salaries and performance bonuses

Who We Are
----------------
theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code. We provide a fun, energetic, and inspirational environment to bring out that inner hacker in all kids! The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World.

http://fremont.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary
-----------------
theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! 
You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience. 

This is a part-time position for anywhere from 2-15 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability.

These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8 pm weekdays and 10 am - 5 pm on Saturday or Sunday.


Responsibilities
-------------------
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.

1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards more advanced platforms. The kids will generally create projects that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculum.

2. Code Coaching Plus. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a project together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.

3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.

This position rocks because you will:
• Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!
• Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.
• Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology
• Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way

Requirements
-----------------
What do we want from you? Read on.

• PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.

• Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!

• Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.

• Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of Python, Java and C++ are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.

Who We Are
theCoderSchool is the #1 after-school coding program in Silicon Valley. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World. 

http://walnutcreek.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary
theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for 2-20 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule. Our open hours will be generally 3:30-7:30pm on select weekdays and Saturday. We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a ""teaching methodology"" than a curriculum. Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.

Responsibilities
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.
1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids. Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger kids and Javascript/HTML, Python and beyond for older kids. Specialty programming like Unity or Swift helpful as well!
2. Plus Session. Teach a group of 10+ year olds how to present their ideas like Steve Jobs. This group session gives our students a chance to play logic games, prepare for their presentation at the quarterly Coder Fairs, and inspire each other.
3. Code Class. Certain coaches that can manage a group of kids will be asked to inspire 7-10 year olds in Code Class. This has a fixed-curriculum for drag-and-drop languages that you'll teach in a classroom style.

This position rocks because you will:
* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application.
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in Silicon Valley.
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology

Requirements
What do we want from you? Read on.
* PASSION. All caps! You ooze excitement for technology; you can't wait to play with the latest 3D gaming platform. Your students must be inspired by your energy and enthusiasm :)
* Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course it's often necessary to explain concepts in a few different ways!
* Kid at heart. Our best coaches understand what gets kids excited because they love the same things: gamers please apply!
* Coding Skills. Strong grasp of basic procedural programming. General knowledge of one or more languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't necessarily required - we prefer you communicate and empathize well with your students. 
* Big bonus for game development and app development: Unity especially.
* Experience teaching kids is a plus

This program creates experts, in Information Technology (IT), quickly.  The five-month, high intensity transformation is the result of a fifteen-year joint effort between Stanford faculty, DARPA (the nation’s premier research organization), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, US Navy, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Acuitus.  
 
Participants start with no experience and exit five months later joining the best in the IT field.  Over 900 have gone through the program.  In the Navy, sailors entered the fleet as the advanced, “goto” ITs, better than the best with ten years of experience; in the commercial world, participants see an average salary increase of 15% per year, over the first five years, adding $3M to their net worth.  We know how to create experts, and we expect everyone who starts the program to succeed – over 98% have completed the program on time, to exceptional standards.   
 
Three elements are fundamental to creating an expert.  What matters is not lectures, projects, text books and grades.  First, becoming an expert begins with accumulating ten years of challenging work experience, where you solve the hard problems, on your own, being transformed in the process.  Second, is developing a real understanding of the hard ideas in the field, along with learning how to think critically and solve hard problems – so you have confidence you can solve any problem.  And third, the only way to acquire the experience and develop the understanding is to have an exceptional mentor at your elbow continually, not to give you answers but to challenge you, always advancing your understanding.  The result is transformational.  The result is the ultimate internship. 
 
The graduates of this program have transitioned into hundreds of companies, in a broad spectrum of industries and industry leaders – Cisco, PayPal, Amazon, EMC, Palo Alto Networks, Brocade, eBay, Microsoft, Akamai to name but a few.  Many are in senior level positions, now running teams and responsible for hiring – asking for hundreds more of our experts per year.    
 
We know what we are doing, we have the theory, data and results to back up our claims, and we deeply believe in what we are doing.  There is a cost for the program, but you only contribute to our effort if you get a job and then only for a fixed period of time.  So the risk is on us, we only succeed when you succeed. 
 
If you want to do something very different, if you want to start a career and not just get an entry-level job, if you want to learn to see the world the way other experts see the world, check it out.  This program is truly different.  This is the way we need to prepare for the future, the way we will prepare for the future. 
 
Note: VETERANS will find this program of particular interest because it presents a way to combine the leadership and management experience acquired during your service with technical expertise, which is a particularly valuable combination in high-tech careers. 
 
Applications being accepted now for October 28th start date.  Learn more https://www.acuitus.com/IT

Who We Are

theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code with several Bay Area locations and growing. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World.  

www.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary


theCoderSchool Cupertino is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world!  You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience.  This is a part-time position for 2-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule.  Our open hours will be generally 3-8pm on select weekdays and 10am-2pm on saturdays.

We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a teaching methodology than a curriculum.  Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.




Responsibilities 

A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code.  At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.


1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.  One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids.  Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger folks, with Python or Javascript/HTML or Java, C++ and beyond for the advanced kids. We currently have a need for a Code Coach who can teach Python, so Python experience is a big plus.

2. PLUS Group Session.  A social group session with a larger student to coach ratio. The coach's role is to mentor the students towards an end goal of presenting one of their apps at our Coder Fair.


3. Code Class.  Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.

This position rocks because you will:
 - Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are excited to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application. 
 - Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.
 - Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology


Requirements

What do we want from you?  Read on.
 - PASSION.  All caps!  This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
 - Great Communicator.  There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
 - Street Cred.  Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school.  Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
 - Coding Skills.  Strong grasp of basic procedural programming.  General knowledge of other languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.
- Teaching Experience.  Experience teaching kids in any subject is a plus, as is experience with Scratch or Snap.

The ULTIMATE INTERNSHIP – For UNDER-EMPLOYED and VETERANS,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sof/d/sunnyvale-the-ultimate-internship-for/6973163731.html,1567781280000,sunnyvale,"

This program creates experts, in Information Technology (IT), quickly.  The five-month, high intensity transformation is the result of a fifteen-year joint effort between Stanford faculty, DARPA (the nation’s premier research organization), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, US Navy, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Acuitus.  
 
Participants start with no experience and exit five months later joining the best in the IT field.  Over 900 have gone through the program.  In the Navy, sailors entered the fleet as the advanced, “goto” ITs, better than the best with ten years of experience; in the commercial world, participants see an average salary increase of 15% per year, over the first five years, adding $3M to their net worth.  We know how to create experts, and we expect everyone who starts the program to succeed – over 98% have completed the program on time, to exceptional standards.   
 
Three elements are fundamental to creating an expert.  What matters is not lectures, projects, text books and grades.  First, becoming an expert begins with accumulating ten years of challenging work experience, where you solve the hard problems, on your own, being transformed in the process.  Second, is developing a real understanding of the hard ideas in the field, along with learning how to think critically and solve hard problems – so you have confidence you can solve any problem.  And third, the only way to acquire the experience and develop the understanding is to have an exceptional mentor at your elbow continually, not to give you answers but to challenge you, always advancing your understanding.  The result is transformational.  The result is the ultimate internship. 
 
The graduates of this program have transitioned into hundreds of companies, in a broad spectrum of industries and industry leaders – Cisco, PayPal, Amazon, EMC, Palo Alto Networks, Brocade, eBay, Microsoft, Akamai to name but a few.  Many are in senior level positions, now running teams and responsible for hiring – asking for hundreds more of our experts per year.    
 
We know what we are doing, we have the theory, data and results to back up our claims, and we deeply believe in what we are doing.  There is a cost for the program, but you only contribute to our effort if you get a job and then only for a fixed period of time.  So the risk is on us, we only succeed when you succeed. 
 
If you want to do something very different, if you want to start a career and not just get an entry-level job, if you want to learn to see the world the way other experts see the world, check it out.  This program is truly different.  This is the way we need to prepare for the future, the way we will prepare for the future. 
 
Note: VETERANS will find this program of particular interest because it presents a way to combine the leadership and management experience acquired during your service with technical expertise, which is a particularly valuable combination in high-tech careers. 
 
Applications being accepted now for September 23rd start date.  Learn more https://www.acuitus.com/IT

The ULTIMATE INTERNSHIP – For UNDER-EMPLOYED and VETERANS,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/sof/d/sunnyvale-the-ultimate-internship-for/6970853806.html,1567517040000,sunnyvale,"

This program creates experts, in Information Technology (IT), quickly.  The five-month, high intensity transformation is the result of a fifteen-year joint effort between Stanford faculty, DARPA (the nation’s premier research organization), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, US Navy, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Acuitus.  
 
Participants start with no experience and exit five months later joining the best in the IT field.  Over 900 have gone through the program.  In the Navy, sailors entered the fleet as the advanced, “goto” ITs, better than the best with ten years of experience; in the commercial world, participants see an average salary increase of 15% per year, over the first five years, adding $3M to their net worth.  We know how to create experts, and we expect everyone who starts the program to succeed – over 98% have completed the program on time, to exceptional standards.   
 
Three elements are fundamental to creating an expert.  What matters is not lectures, projects, text books and grades.  First, becoming an expert begins with accumulating ten years of challenging work experience, where you solve the hard problems, on your own, being transformed in the process.  Second, is developing a real understanding of the hard ideas in the field, along with learning how to think critically and solve hard problems – so you have confidence you can solve any problem.  And third, the only way to acquire the experience and develop the understanding is to have an exceptional mentor at your elbow continually, not to give you answers but to challenge you, always advancing your understanding.  The result is transformational.  The result is the ultimate internship. 
 
The graduates of this program have transitioned into hundreds of companies, in a broad spectrum of industries and industry leaders – Cisco, PayPal, Amazon, EMC, Palo Alto Networks, Brocade, eBay, Microsoft, Akamai to name but a few.  Many are in senior level positions, now running teams and responsible for hiring – asking for hundreds more of our experts per year.    
 
We know what we are doing, we have the theory, data and results to back up our claims, and we deeply believe in what we are doing.  There is a cost for the program, but you only contribute to our effort if you get a job and then only for a fixed period of time.  So the risk is on us, we only succeed when you succeed. 
 
If you want to do something very different, if you want to start a career and not just get an entry-level job, if you want to learn to see the world the way other experts see the world, check it out.  This program is truly different.  This is the way we need to prepare for the future, the way we will prepare for the future. 
 
Note: VETERANS will find this program of particular interest because it presents a way to combine the leadership and management experience acquired during your service with technical expertise, which is a particularly valuable combination in high-tech careers. 
 
Applications being accepted now for September 23rd start date.  Learn more https://www.acuitus.com/IT
    ","The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern and is unpaid; participants have historically transitioned into positions starting at $60,000 to $120,000/year."
